# The Night Will Always Win (TNWAW)

A Project Zomboid mod.

Inspired by the Night Sprinters mod.

The core focus of this mod is to allow customization of zombie behaviors during the night, rain, fog, and other events. This mod does not alter behavior until enabled in Mod's entry in the sandbox options. Settings should take effect immediately.

Current version only supports mutating speed, memory, hearing, and sight.

This mod has a unique feature of 'phasing' the mutations towards their target setting. For example, if you have zombies set as shamblers and night zombies set to sprinters; the zombies will phase from shamblers, to fast shamblers, to sprinters given a set timeout phase.
