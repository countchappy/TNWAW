# The Night Will Always Win (TNWAW)

A Project Zomboid mod.

Inspired by the Night Sprinters mod.

The core focus of this mod is to allow customization of zombie behaviors during the night or during a storm. This mod does not alter behavior until enabled in Mod's entry in the sandbox options. Settings should take effect immediately.

Current version only supports mutating speed.

This mod has a uniqure feature of 'phasing' the mutations towards their target setting. For example, if you have zombies set as shamblers and night zombies set to sprinters; the zombies will phase from shamblers, to fast shamblers, to sprinters given a set timeout phase.
